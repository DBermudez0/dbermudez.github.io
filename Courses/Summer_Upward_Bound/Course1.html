<h1> Biomedical Engineering (BME): A Brief Introduction (NYU Upward Bound Program)</h1>

<p> Instructor: Dalton H Bermudez </p>

<h3> <b> Summary: </b> </h3> 
<p> The objective of the course is to introduce high school students to the field of biomedical engineering. The course starts by describing different subspecialties within biomedical engineering. Then, it dives into different non-invasive technology used in different BME subspecialties such as in Medical Physics and Neural Engineering. This course will be a good introduction for students planning to potentially ingress into the medical field. Such students may perhaps be in a PRE-Registered Nursing program or interested in the field of cognitive neuroscience. </p>
